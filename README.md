Computer Environment [![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MATLAB-R2022a-green.svg "MATLAB")](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/matlab.html "MATLAB"):
-
- MATLAB R2022a (requires Parallel Computing Toolbox installed)
- If your working environment cannot enable parallel pooling, please replace *parfor* with *for*


File:
-
- code: subfunction used in the NAE process
- data: all datasets.
- demo.m: run the simulation example

The core interface function of NAE is code\refer_NAE.m

    [newgra,obj,opt] = refer_NAE(data,network,Lp,parameter);

where *data* represents the gene expression profile of the time series; *network* is the network to be evaluated; *Lp* represents the norm type used; *parameter* is a structure, where parameter.i is the regularization parameter that must be set. The return value *newgra* is the inference network, *obj* is the loss value generated by each iteration, and *opt* is the parameter used.
